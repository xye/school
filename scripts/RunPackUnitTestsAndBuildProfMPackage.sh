# This script is designed specifically for Jenkins.  It runs the Jasmine and PHPUnit tests associated with the Pack
# script.  It also builds the Professor M module loadable package.

# If you are running Jenkins in a Docker container and mounting /var/jenkins_home to a directory on your machine's
# local filesystem, you may need to update LOCALWORKSPACEPATH to reflect the path to the Jenkins workspace on your local
# filesystem (for example: "/Users/lschaefer/jenkins/workspace/ProfessorM". The easiest way to update LOCALWORKSPACEPATH
# is to pass in the value as an argument when you call this script.

LOCALWORKSPACEPATH=$1

# Remove any lingering containers from previously failed builds
docker rm my-yarn --force || true
docker rm my-composer --force || true

# Run the Jasmine tests
docker pull sugarcrmdev/school:yarn
docker run -t -d -v $LOCALWORKSPACEPATH:/workspace --name my-yarn sugarcrmdev/school:yarn
docker exec my-yarn yarn install
docker exec my-yarn yarn global add grunt-cli
docker exec my-yarn grunt test-js

# Run the PHPUnit tests
docker pull sugarcrmdev/school:composer
docker run -t -d -v $LOCALWORKSPACEPATH:/workspace --name my-composer sugarcrmdev/school:composer
docker exec my-composer composer install
docker exec my-composer vendor/bin/phpunit

# Generate the Standard and Windows versions Professor M module loadable package
docker exec my-composer sh -c "cd package && php ./pack.php -v jenkins"
docker exec my-composer sh -c "cd package && php ./pack.php -v jenkins -w 40"

# Remove the containers
docker rm my-yarn --force
docker rm my-composer --force
